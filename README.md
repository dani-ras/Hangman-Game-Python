# Hangman-Game-Python

Welcome.
This game was made during my learning of python, main program runs through `index.py`.
Modules are being used to ease mangagement and readability.

after running `index.py` the game is launched in the terminal. ASCII art is being used.
Player gets to choose a file path to a text file with words bank (format of single whitespace between each word).
Then player chooses a number which will determine the secret word.
(any integer is accceptable, greater number then total size of bank is looped over from the beginning).
Player gets 6 guesses to reveal the sercret word.
